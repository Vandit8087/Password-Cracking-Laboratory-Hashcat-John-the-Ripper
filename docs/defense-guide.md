# Defense Strategies and Countermeasures

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing effective defense strategies against password cracking attacks, covering policy development, technical countermeasures, and organizational security practices.

## Password Policy Development

### Length-Based Security Requirements

Modern password policies must prioritize length over complexity to provide effective protection against automated attacks. Research demonstrates that 12-character passwords provide baseline security, while 16+ character requirements approach practical immunity against current cracking capabilities.

**Recommended Length Requirements:**
- **Minimum**: 12 characters for standard accounts
- **Recommended**: 14-16 characters for enhanced security
- **Critical Systems**: 20+ characters or passphrases
- **Administrative**: 16+ characters with additional controls

### Complexity Requirements Balance

Traditional complexity requirements often result in predictable patterns easily compromised through rule-based attacks. Effective policies balance security with usability by focusing on entropy rather than character class mandates.

**Balanced Complexity Approach:**
```
Instead of: "Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols"
Use: "Password must be at least 14 characters with high entropy"
```

**Entropy Calculation Guidelines:**
- Each unique character adds log2(character_set_size) bits of entropy
- Randomness provides more security than predictable complexity
- Passphrases offer superior entropy with improved memorability

### Prohibited Password Patterns

Password policies must explicitly prohibit common patterns exploited by rule-based attacks:

**Prohibited Patterns:**
- Dictionary words with simple substitutions (e.g., P@ssw0rd)
- Sequential characters (123456, abcdef)
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf)
- Company/personal information derivatives
- Previously breached passwords (HaveIBeenPwned integration)
- Common password + year/number combinations

### Password Rotation Policies

Modern security research challenges traditional password rotation requirements, which often lead to weaker password selection and user fatigue.

**Evidence-Based Rotation Strategy:**
- **Standard Accounts**: Rotate only upon compromise indication
- **Privileged Accounts**: Quarterly rotation with strong generation
- **Service Accounts**: Automated rotation with credential management
- **Emergency Response**: Immediate rotation upon security incidents

## Technical Countermeasures

### Secure Hashing Algorithm Implementation

Organizations must migrate from legacy hashing algorithms to modern, memory-hard functions that resist GPU-accelerated attacks.

#### bcrypt Implementation
```python
import bcrypt

# Generate salt and hash password
salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)  # Cost factor 12
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)

# Verify password
if bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed):
    print("Password verified")
```

**bcrypt Configuration:**
- **Cost Factor**: 12-15 (adjust based on performance requirements)
- **Salt Generation**: Unique salt per password
- **Storage**: Store salt and hash together
- **Performance**: ~100ms verification time target

#### Argon2 Implementation
```python
import argon2

# Initialize Argon2 hasher
ph = argon2.PasswordHasher(
    time_cost=3,      # Number of iterations
    memory_cost=65536, # Memory usage in KiB
    parallelism=1,    # Number of parallel threads
    hash_len=32,      # Hash output length
    salt_len=16       # Salt length
)

# Hash password
hashed = ph.hash(password)

# Verify password
try:
    ph.verify(hashed, password)
    print("Password verified")
except argon2.exceptions.VerifyMismatchError:
    print("Password verification failed")
```

**Argon2 Configuration Guidelines:**
- **Time Cost**: 3-10 iterations based on security requirements
- **Memory Cost**: 64MB-1GB depending on available resources
- **Parallelism**: Match available CPU cores
- **Regular Tuning**: Adjust parameters as hardware improves

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation

MFA provides the most effective single countermeasure against password-based attacks, maintaining security even when credentials become compromised.

#### MFA Technology Comparison

| Technology | Security Level | Usability | Cost | Phishing Resistance |
|------------|---------------|-----------|------|-------------------|
| SMS | Low | High | Low | No |
| TOTP Apps | Medium | Medium | Low | No |
| Push Notifications | Medium | High | Medium | Limited |
| Hardware Tokens | High | Medium | High | Yes |
| Biometrics | High | High | High | Yes |
| WebAuthn/FIDO2 | Very High | High | Medium | Yes |

#### TOTP Implementation Example
```python
import pyotp
import qrcode

# Generate secret key
secret = pyotp.random_base32()

# Create TOTP object
totp = pyotp.TOTP(secret)

# Generate QR code for user setup
provisioning_uri = totp.provisioning_uri(
    name="user@company.com",
    issuer_name="Company Name"
)

qr = qrcode.QRCode()
qr.add_data(provisioning_uri)
qr.make()

# Verify TOTP token
token = input("Enter 6-digit token: ")
if totp.verify(token):
    print("Token verified successfully")
```

### Account Lockout Mechanisms

Implement intelligent account lockout systems that balance security with usability:

#### Adaptive Lockout Strategy
```python
class AdaptiveLockout:
    def __init__(self):
        self.failed_attempts = {}
        self.lockout_times = [60, 300, 900, 3600]  # Progressive lockout
    
    def record_failed_attempt(self, username, ip_address):
        key = f"{username}:{ip_address}"
        if key not in self.failed_attempts:
            self.failed_attempts[key] = 0
        
        self.failed_attempts[key] += 1
        
        # Apply progressive lockout
        attempts = self.failed_attempts[key]
        if attempts >= len(self.lockout_times):
            lockout_duration = self.lockout_times[-1]
        else:
            lockout_duration = self.lockout_times[attempts - 1]
        
        return lockout_duration
```

**Lockout Configuration:**
- **Threshold**: 5-10 failed attempts before initial lockout
- **Progressive Duration**: Increase lockout time with repeated failures
- **Geographic Consideration**: Different thresholds for unusual locations
- **Administrative Override**: Emergency access procedures

### Rate Limiting Implementation

Implement rate limiting at multiple layers to prevent automated attacks:

#### Application-Layer Rate Limiting
```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("5 per minute")
def login():
    # Login logic here
    pass
```

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- **Per-IP Limits**: 5-10 login attempts per minute
- **Per-User Limits**: Account-specific attempt tracking
- **Geographic Limits**: Stricter limits for unusual locations
- **API Endpoints**: Separate limits for different endpoint types

## Monitoring and Detection Systems

### Authentication Event Monitoring

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for authentication events:

#### Essential Log Events
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "authentication_failure",
  "username": "user@company.com",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "failure_reason": "invalid_password",
  "geographic_location": "New York, NY",
  "threat_score": 0.3
}
```

**Monitoring Categories:**
- **Failed Authentication Attempts**: Track patterns and frequencies
- **Successful Logins**: Monitor for anomalies in time/location
- **Password Changes**: Log all password modification events
- **Account Lockouts**: Monitor lockout triggers and patterns
- **MFA Events**: Track MFA failures and bypass attempts

### Behavioral Analytics Implementation

Deploy behavioral analytics to identify compromised credentials even after successful authentication:

#### Anomaly Detection Metrics
```python
class BehaviorAnalyzer:
    def analyze_login_pattern(self, user_id, login_data):
        metrics = {
            'time_anomaly': self.check_time_pattern(user_id, login_data),
            'location_anomaly': self.check_location_pattern(user_id, login_data),
            'device_anomaly': self.check_device_pattern(user_id, login_data),
            'access_pattern_anomaly': self.check_access_pattern(user_id, login_data)
        }
        
        risk_score = sum(metrics.values()) / len(metrics)
        return risk_score
```

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Time Patterns**: Unusual login times compared to historical data
- **Geographic Patterns**: Logins from unexpected locations
- **Device Patterns**: New or unusual device characteristics
- **Access Patterns**: Unusual resource access after authentication

### SIEM Integration

Integrate authentication monitoring with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:

#### SIEM Rule Examples
```yaml
# High-risk authentication pattern
rule_name: "Credential Stuffing Attack"
conditions:
  - failed_logins > 100 per hour
  - unique_usernames > 50
  - source_ip_count < 5
action: "alert_security_team"

# Compromised credential indicator  
rule_name: "Impossible Travel"
conditions:
  - successful_login
  - previous_login_location != current_location
  - travel_time < physically_possible
action: "force_mfa_verification"
```

## Password Management Solutions

### Enterprise Password Manager Deployment

Implement enterprise password managers to eliminate user burden while maintaining security standards:

#### Password Manager Selection Criteria
